Moringa Oleifera Nutritional Dataset
Overview
The Moringa Oleifera Nutritional Dataset provides a collection of randomly generated samples representing the nutritional values of the Moringa oleifera plant, commonly known as the "drumstick tree" or "miracle tree." This dataset is intended for educational, research, and data analysis purposes.

The dataset contains 100 samples with various nutritional values such as protein, vitamins, minerals, and fiber content typically found in Moringa oleifera. The values are generated within realistic ranges to reflect the plant's nutrient density and health benefits.

Dataset Description
The dataset is stored in a CSV file named moringa_oleifera_nutritional_dataset.csv. Each row represents a unique sample of Moringa oleifera's nutritional composition.

Columns
Column Name	Description
Sample ID	A unique identifier for each sample in the format MOR-XXXX, where XXXX is a random number.
Protein (g)	The protein content in grams (g) per 100 grams of Moringa oleifera leaves or parts.
Vitamin A (mg)	The amount of Vitamin A in milligrams (mg) per 100 grams of Moringa oleifera.
Vitamin C (mg)	The amount of Vitamin C in milligrams (mg) per 100 grams of Moringa oleifera.
Calcium (mg)	The calcium content in milligrams (mg) per 100 grams of Moringa oleifera.
Potassium (mg)	The potassium content in milligrams (mg) per 100 grams of Moringa oleifera.
Iron (mg)	The iron content in milligrams (mg) per 100 grams of Moringa oleifera.
Fiber (g)	The dietary fiber content in grams (g) per 100 grams of Moringa oleifera.
Calories (kcal)	The energy provided by Moringa oleifera in kilocalories (kcal) per 100 grams.
Data Generation
Protein (g): Random values ranging from 2.0 to 9.0 grams per 100 grams. Moringa oleifera is known for its high protein content, particularly in its leaves.

Vitamin A (mg): Random values between 0.1 to 0.9 milligrams. Vitamin A is crucial for vision, immune function, and skin health.

Vitamin C (mg): Random values between 50.0 to 250.0 milligrams. Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis, immune function, and antioxidant protection.

Calcium (mg): Random values from 200.0 to 400.0 milligrams. Calcium is vital for bone health and metabolic functions.

Potassium (mg): Random values between 150.0 to 400.0 milligrams. Potassium helps in maintaining fluid balance and proper nerve and muscle function.

Iron (mg): Random values ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 milligrams. Iron is essential for hemoglobin formation and oxygen transport in the body.

Fiber (g): Random values between 2.0 to 8.0 grams. Fiber is important for digestive health and cholesterol management.

Calories (kcal): Random values from 30 to 70 kilocalories. Moringa oleifera is low in calories but highly nutritious.
